  <div class = "text"><h1>Bauhaus Project</h1>
  <p>The  art work I chose to take inspiration from my project is the â€œHomunculus'' by Johannes Molzahn. I chose this art piece because I like how the colors  and shapes played on the canvas. What I decided to make was using a color picker and getting the color codes to take the essence of the artwork and transform it into something of my own. 
    I also used different types of animations to make it more eye catching and using  different colors to complement the palette and make it a pleasing aesthetic to the eye. One of the difficulties was making the animations work well together, also having the painstaking patiences to upload it to github.</p></div>
